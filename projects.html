            <h3><u>School-book</u></h3>
            <p><b>Setting</b>: MIT Media Lab | Cambridge, MA | Summer 2020 </p>
            <p><b>Keywords</b>: School-book, Misinformation, Middle-school, GANs</p>
            <p><b>Context</b><br> The Media Lab is an anti-disciplinary research lab with dozens of groups working at the intersection of technology, media, science, art, and design. The Personal Robots Group works on developing fun and innovative ways of teaching AI across all levels of education. </p>
            <p><b>Description</b><br>
              A study on misinformation, conducted by a different group, showed that misinformation spreads about 6 times faster than real information. This can have serious implications when it comes to activities, such as voting, protesting, etc, that involve collective decision-making. The goal of this NSF-funded project was to raise awareness in young children about the threats of misinformation and how they can be more alert when they're online. We ended up developing School-book, a fun headline-sharing platform, which allowed students to directly witness how the information they shared with others spread in their network. I was responsible for designing and developing School-bookâ€™s front-end and back-end. I also collaborated with Grace Kim in integrating her visualization code with School-book.
            </p>
            <p><b>Results</b>: In a period of ~2 months, we used school-book in 5 workshops with over 100 students total.</p>
