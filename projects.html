            <h3><u>School-book</u></h3>
            <p><b>Setting</b>: MIT Media Lab | Cambridge, MA | Summer 2020 </p>
            <p><b>Keywords</b>: School-book, Misinformation, Middle-school, GANs</p>
            <p><b>Context</b><br> The Media Lab is an anti-disciplinary research lab with dozens of groups working at the intersection of technology, media, science, art, and design. The Personal Robots Group works on developing fun and innovative ways of teaching AI across all levels of education. </p>
            <p><b>Description</b><br>
              A study on misinformation, conducted by a different group, showed that misinformation spreads about 6 times faster than real information. This can have serious implications when it comes to activities, such as voting, protesting, etc, that involve collective decision-making. The goal of this NSF-funded project was to raise awareness in young children about the threats of misinformation and how they can be more alert when they're online. We ended up developing School-book, a fun headline-sharing platform, which allowed students to directly witness how the information they shared with others spread in their network. I was responsible for designing and developing School-book’s front-end and back-end.
            </p>
            <p><b>Results</b>: In a period of ~2 months, we used school-book in 5 workshops with over 100 students total.</p>

            <h3><u>Affdex+TeleHealth</u></h3>
            <p><b>Setting</b>: Affectiva | Remote | Summer 2020 </p>
            <p><b>Keywords</b>: Affdex, Web development, Patient-doctor video calls</p>
            <p><b>Context</b><br> Affectiva is an AI company that uses and develops computer vision and natural language processing technologies, combined with a lot of in-house curated datasets to do affect appraisal along multiple modalities. Their software’s applications span multiple industries including gaming, robotics, education, healthcare, experiential marketing, retail, human resources etc. </p>
            <p><b>Description</b><br>
              On my team’s month-long project, we set out to apply Affdex, Affectiva’s tool that’s tuned to recognize a host of facial expressions, to virtual patient-doctor interactions. Our solution was a web application that executed real-time emotion recognition over 1:1 video calls. From the doctor’s side, we used Affectiva’s Affdex SDK and Zoom’s web SDK to process the video feeds from them and their patient. We then slightly modified the Zoom interface by adding a ‘Get Analysis’ button that the doctor could use at the end of the session to see charts of the session’s expressions by both themselves and their patient.
            </p>
            <p><b>Results</b>: My team and I presented to a panel of Affectiva engineers, some of whom developed  Affdex.</p>
